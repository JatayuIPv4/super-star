<div align="center">

### Your repository might be great, so let's share it with everybody!

#### In one year, I have managed to grow [Novu](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/) to `20,000` GitHub stars.

##### It's not pure luck, I have managed to tackle multiple subjects such as:


| <p align="left">🏅 Perfecting the GitHub README file</p> <p align="left">🏅 Attracting contributors for your repository</p> <p align="left">🏅 Getting content writers to write about you</p> <p align="left">🏅 Appearing on [GitHub trending feed](https://github.com/trending) multiple times</p>  <p align="left">🏅 Getting trending articles every week on [DEV.to](https://dev.to/nevodavid)</p>  <p align="left">🏅 Constant Reddit growth</p>  <p align="left">🏅 Using the power of influencers</p>  <p align="left">🏅 Using big events such as [HackSquad](https://hacksquad.dev)</p> |

<h2 align="left">What can you do here?</h1>
<div align="left">
  <p>I have created a course on <a href="https://github20k.com">how to get 20k GitHub stars</a></p>
  <p>The course has a sales page, and the entire source code of the page can be found here 🚀</p>
  <p>The course focus a little on strategies, and more about tactics.</p>
  <p>I will show you <code>step-by-step</code> what I am actually doing.</p>
  <p>In case you don't need the course, feel free to use this repository for your own sales page.</p>
  <p>The tech being used here: <strong>NextJS, Tailwind, Stripe, Mailchimp and Teachable</strong></p>


  <p>&nbsp;</p>

## How it works

<img width="515" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100117126/227772309-8612c369-abf0-4880-bdad-ad2eab602100.png">

<p>The website was created using NextJS and Tailwind.</p>
<p>When you click on the checkout button, you will be taken to a a checkout out (default to Stripe).</p>
<p> After you complete the checkout process, the payment gateway will send a webhook to a special NextJS route (/api/purchase)</p>
<p>On this route, the purchaser is added to:</p>

- The newsletter (default to MailChimp)
- The course (default to Teachable) 
- The CRM (default to Pipedrive).

## Installation

<p>Clone the project, copy the .env.example file to .env, and fill in the missing variables.</p>

  <p>And then run</p>

  ```bash
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```
